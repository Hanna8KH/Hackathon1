Hello Anna. It was such a pleasure to correct your Hackaton project. I loved it. You implement almost everything
we learn in class and very well. Loved the game and how it is incrementing the amount of squares after every win. 
Very well done DOM manipulation, event listeners, animations, and use of timeout and interval. Your code is DRY
and organized. And the final product it is a lovely game.

Congratulations On your Hackaton Keep the good work.
